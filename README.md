# SwissVim
Vim configruations for the swiss (de) keyboard layout.
I'm at the beginning of my vim journey. If you have any feedback, please let me know.

## Key adjsutments
I like using the following keys for going up, down, left, right:

- `j`: left
- `i`: up
- `l`: right
- `k`: down

Other changes are:

- `ö`: Go to insert mode
- `jk`: Go to normal mode
- `ü`: Go to the beginning of the line
